export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Included Stands Vary from Tilt-Only to Full Ergonomic Adjustment",
    "explanation": "Don't assume a 4K monitor's included stand offers height adjustment just because competing models do, the range varies from tilt-only to full ergonomic movement, check the specific stand spec against your desk setup, and if it falls short, a VESA-compatible monitor arm is usually a straightforward add-on rather than a dealbreaker."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Color Gamut Coverage Percentage Only Matters if Your Work Actually Needs It",
    "explanation": "Not every buyer needs wide color gamut coverage on a 4K monitor, general use and office work are well served by standard SRGB coverage, but color-critical work like video editing or print design benefits specifically from high DCI-P3 or Adobe RGB percentages, verify which gamut standard actually matters for your work before paying a premium for wide coverage you won't use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "USB-C Power Delivery Wattage Determines Whether It Can Actually Charge Your Laptop",
    "explanation": "A 4K monitor's USB-C port often carries power delivery alongside video and data, but the actual wattage varies by model (commonly 65W to 96W), a lower-wattage port may trickle-charge a laptop slower than it drains under load or not charge a power-hungry laptop at all, check the monitor's stated PD wattage against your specific laptop's charging requirement rather than assuming any USB-C monitor fully powers any laptop."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IPS, OLED, and VA Panels Trade Contrast, Color, and Motion Differently",
    "explanation": "An IPS 4K monitor delivers accurate, consistent color from wide viewing angles but has weaker black levels than OLED, an OLED panel produces true per-pixel black and near-instant response but carries burn-in risk with static content over years of use, a VA panel sits between the two with strong contrast but slower pixel response, match the panel type to whether color accuracy, contrast, or motion clarity matters most for your use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "A Curved 4K Monitor Helps Peripheral Immersion but Can Distort Straight-Line Work",
    "explanation": "Curvature on a 4K monitor is a genuine tradeoff, not a pure upgrade, it reduces eye strain from edge-to-edge scanning on wider panels and adds immersion for gaming or movies, but that same curve introduces visible distortion in perfectly straight lines, which matters for spreadsheet, CAD, or design work where flat accuracy counts."

export const faq = [
  {

    "q": "Do I need wide color gamut coverage?",
    "a": "Only for color-critical work like video editing or print design, general use and office work are well served by standard SRGB coverage, check which gamut standard actually matters for your workflow."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Why isn't my 4K monitor hitting its advertised refresh rate?",
    "a": "0 caps out around 60Hz at full 4K regardless of what the panel itself is rated for."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Should I get an IPS, OLED, or VA 4K monitor?",
    "a": "IPS gives the most consistent accurate color, OLED gives the deepest contrast and fastest response with a real long-term burn-in risk on static content, VA splits the difference with strong contrast but slower response, match to your primary use."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Will a USB-C 4K monitor charge my laptop?",
    "a": "Only if its power delivery wattage matches or exceeds your laptop's charging requirement, check the monitor's specific PD wattage spec rather than assuming any USB-C monitor fully charges any laptop."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Can I trust the response time number on the box?",
    "a": "Not fully, it's usually a best-case lab number under aggressive overdrive settings, real-world motion clarity is often worse and can show ghosting, check independent motion-clarity reviews instead."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Is a smaller 4K monitor harder to use than a larger one?",
    "a": "It needs OS-level scaling to keep text readable, which works well in most modern software but can render blurry in some older or niche applications, verify your specific software handles scaling before buying a smaller panel."
