  {
    "criterion": "Inside-Out Tracking Is More Convenient but Can Struggle in Certain Rooms",
    "explanation": "Most modern VR headsets use inside-out tracking, where cameras on the headset itself track your position without needing external sensors placed around the room, convenient for setup, but inside-out tracking can struggle in rooms with poor lighting, reflective surfaces, or very open layouts, an older external-sensor tracking system is more setup work but can be more consistently accurate in a difficult room, check reviews for tracking reliability if your play space has unusual lighting or layout."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Internal Storage Caps How Many Apps and Games You Keep Installed at Once",
    "explanation": "A standalone VR headset's internal storage (commonly 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB) determines how many games and apps you can keep installed simultaneously, VR game file sizes have grown significantly, and a smaller storage tier fills up faster than expected, requiring you to uninstall and redownload titles regularly, check your realistic app library size against the storage tier rather than assuming the base storage option is sufficient long-term."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Eye Resolution Determines Text Clarity and the 'Screen Door Effect'",
    "explanation": "Marketing sometimes lists a VR headset's combined resolution across both eyes, which inflates the number compared to what each eye actually sees, check the true per-eye resolution specifically, since that determines whether you notice the screen door effect (visible gaps between pixels) and how readable in-game text is at a glance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller Tracking Accuracy Varies Even Between Headsets With Similar Specs",
    "explanation": "Controller tracking reliability is a variable spec that doesn't always correlate with headset resolution or price, tracking can degrade when a controller moves out of camera view during fast or wide motions, this matters significantly for rhythm games, fitness apps, or fast-paced shooters, check dedicated controller tracking reviews for your specific intended use."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pancake Lenses Enable Slimmer Headsets With Fewer Visual Artifacts Than Fresnel",
    "explanation": "Older VR headsets commonly use Fresnel lenses, which are inexpensive but produce visible 'god rays' (light streaking) around bright objects against dark backgrounds, newer pancake lens designs fold the light path to enable a slimmer headset with meaningfully reduced glare artifacts and better edge-to-edge clarity, but pancake-lens headsets often cost more, check which lens type a headset uses if visual clarity and minimal glare matter for your use."

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does VR tracking work in any room?",
    "a": "Inside-out tracking can struggle in poorly lit rooms, near reflective surfaces, or unusually shaped spaces, check specific tracking reliability reviews if your play space has any of these challenges."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Which VR headset is most comfortable for long sessions?",
    "a": "Check reviews for weight distribution, not just total weight, a design with rear-mounted weight like a battery pack balances the load better than a front-heavy design that concentrates weight on the face."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Can a VR headset cause motion sickness?",
    "a": "It can, particularly at lower refresh rates, if you or the intended user is sensitive to VR discomfort, prioritize a headset running at 90Hz or higher over other specs."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does field of view really matter in VR?",
    "a": "Yes, more than most buyers expect, a narrow field of view can feel like looking through a mask, a wider field of view meaningfully increases immersion, especially for exploration-focused content."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Should I get a standalone or PC VR headset?",
    "a": "Standalone offers real freedom from cables and a computer but caps out at mobile-chip-level graphics, PC-tethered unlocks far more demanding visuals but needs a gaming PC and either a cable or a solid wireless streaming setup."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "How much storage do I need on a standalone VR headset?",
    "a": "More than the base tier usually offers, VR game file sizes have grown significantly, a smaller storage tier fills up faster than expected and forces regular uninstall-and-redownload cycles."
