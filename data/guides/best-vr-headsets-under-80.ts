export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Headset Weight Distribution Matters More Than Total Weight for Extended Sessions",
    "explanation": "A VR headset's comfort during longer sessions depends more on how its weight is distributed than its raw total weight, a front-heavy design that concentrates weight on the face creates fatigue and pressure points faster than a similarly weighted headset with a rear battery pack that balances the load, check reviews specifically for comfort during extended sessions rather than comparing total weight numbers alone."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Field of View Affects Immersion More Than Most Buyers Initially Expect",
    "explanation": "A VR headset's field of view (measured in degrees) determines how much of your peripheral vision is filled by the virtual scene, a narrower field of view (around 90-100 degrees) can feel like looking through binoculars or a diving mask, while a wider field of view (110 degrees and up) fills more of your natural vision for a meaningfully more immersive experience, this matters more for exploration and immersive games than for seated experiences like racing sims."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Higher Refresh Rates Reduce Motion Sickness for Sensitive Users",
    "explanation": "Refresh rate matters for comfort as much as visual smoothness in VR, users prone to motion sickness generally do better with headsets running at 90Hz or higher, a lower refresh rate can worsen the disconnect between head movement and visual update that triggers discomfort, if motion sickness has been an issue before, this spec deserves priority over resolution or other headline numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Eye Resolution Determines Text Clarity and the 'Screen Door Effect'",
    "explanation": "A VR headset's resolution is typically stated per eye, lower per-eye resolution can produce a visible 'screen door effect' where the gaps between pixels are noticeable, especially distracting when reading in-game text, higher per-eye resolution reduces this effect substantially but demands more graphics processing power to render, check the stated per-eye resolution rather than a combined total, which can make a headset sound sharper than it actually is."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IPD Adjustment Range Affects Whether the Headset Actually Fits Your Eyes Clearly",
    "explanation": "A VR headset's interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustment lets you match the lens spacing to your own eyes, a headset with a narrow or stepped IPD adjustment range may not focus clearly for users outside the average range, while a continuous, wide-range adjustment accommodates more face shapes, check the stated IPD adjustment range against your own measured IPD if you're unsure it falls within the average range a headset typically supports."

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What are 'god rays' in a VR headset?",
    "a": "Light streaking around bright objects against dark backgrounds, common with cheaper Fresnel lenses, newer pancake lens designs reduce this glare meaningfully but typically cost more."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does field of view really matter in VR?",
    "a": "Yes, more than most buyers expect, a narrow field of view can feel like looking through a mask, a wider field of view meaningfully increases immersion, especially for exploration-focused content."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What resolution should I look for in a VR headset?",
    "a": "Check the true per-eye resolution, not a combined total across both eyes, a low per-eye resolution can produce a visible screen door effect that's especially distracting when reading in-game text."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Which VR headset is most comfortable for long sessions?",
    "a": "Check reviews for weight distribution, not just total weight, a design with rear-mounted weight like a battery pack balances the load better than a front-heavy design that concentrates weight on the face."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Can a VR headset cause motion sickness?",
    "a": "It can, particularly at lower refresh rates, if you or the intended user is sensitive to VR discomfort, prioritize a headset running at 90Hz or higher over other specs."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What if a VR headset doesn't fit my eyes clearly?",
    "a": "Check the IPD adjustment range, a headset with only a few fixed steps may leave users outside the average range with a persistently blurry image, a continuous adjustment range accommodates more people."
