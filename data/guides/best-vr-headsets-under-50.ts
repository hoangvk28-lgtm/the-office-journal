  {
    "criterion": "Standalone and PC-Tethered Headsets Solve Different Priorities",
    "explanation": "The standalone versus PC-tethered choice is the single biggest factor in a VR headset's real capability, standalone offers real freedom from cables and a computer but caps out at mobile-chip-level graphics, PC-tethered unlocks far more demanding visuals but needs a gaming PC and either a cable or a solid wireless streaming setup, decide based on what you actually want to play."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Internal Storage Caps How Many Apps and Games You Keep Installed at Once",
    "explanation": "A standalone VR headset's internal storage (commonly 128GB, 256GB, or 512GB) determines how many games and apps you can keep installed simultaneously, VR game file sizes have grown significantly, and a smaller storage tier fills up faster than expected, requiring you to uninstall and redownload titles regularly, check your realistic app library size against the storage tier rather than assuming the base storage option is sufficient long-term."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Eye Resolution Determines Text Clarity and the 'Screen Door Effect'",
    "explanation": "Marketing sometimes lists a VR headset's combined resolution across both eyes, which inflates the number compared to what each eye actually sees, check the true per-eye resolution specifically, since that determines whether you notice the screen door effect (visible gaps between pixels) and how readable in-game text is at a glance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Inside-Out Tracking Is More Convenient but Can Struggle in Certain Rooms",
    "explanation": "Inside-out tracking (cameras built into the headset) has become the standard because it eliminates the setup hassle of placing external sensors, but it can lose reliable tracking in poorly lit rooms, near reflective surfaces, or in unusually shaped spaces, if your intended play area has any of these challenges, check specific tracking reliability reviews before assuming any modern headset handles it equally well."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IPD Adjustment Range Affects Whether the Headset Actually Fits Your Eyes Clearly",
    "explanation": "IPD adjustment isn't a minor comfort feature, it directly affects whether the image appears in sharp focus, a headset with only a few fixed IPD steps may leave users at either end of the range with a persistently blurry image, a continuous adjustment range accommodates more people accurately, check this spec if you have reason to think your IPD falls outside the typical range."

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Can a VR headset cause motion sickness?",
    "a": "It can, particularly at lower refresh rates, if you or the intended user is sensitive to VR discomfort, prioritize a headset running at 90Hz or higher over other specs."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What resolution should I look for in a VR headset?",
    "a": "Check the true per-eye resolution, not a combined total across both eyes, a low per-eye resolution can produce a visible screen door effect that's especially distracting when reading in-game text."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does field of view really matter in VR?",
    "a": "Yes, more than most buyers expect, a narrow field of view can feel like looking through a mask, a wider field of view meaningfully increases immersion, especially for exploration-focused content."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "How much storage do I need on a standalone VR headset?",
    "a": "More than the base tier usually offers, VR game file sizes have grown significantly, a smaller storage tier fills up faster than expected and forces regular uninstall-and-redownload cycles."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does VR tracking work in any room?",
    "a": "Inside-out tracking can struggle in poorly lit rooms, near reflective surfaces, or unusually shaped spaces, check specific tracking reliability reviews if your play space has any of these challenges."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What are 'god rays' in a VR headset?",
    "a": "Light streaking around bright objects against dark backgrounds, common with cheaper Fresnel lenses, newer pancake lens designs reduce this glare meaningfully but typically cost more."
