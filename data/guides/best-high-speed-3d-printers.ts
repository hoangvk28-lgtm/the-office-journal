export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Standard Brass Nozzles Wear Out Quickly on Abrasive Filaments",
    "explanation": "Filament abrasiveness is a real factor most first-time buyers overlook, a brass nozzle wears out quickly under carbon-fiber or metal-infused filaments, gradually widening and degrading print accuracy, if abrasive materials are part of your plan, budget for a hardened steel or ruby nozzle upgrade rather than assuming the stock brass nozzle will hold up."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "SD Card, USB, and Wi-Fi Options Change How You Actually Send Print Jobs",
    "explanation": "A 3D printer that only accepts an SD card requires physically moving the card between your computer and the printer for every job, a USB connection lets you print directly from slicing software but ties the printer to a nearby computer during the entire print, Wi-Fi connectivity lets you send jobs remotely and monitor progress from another room, match the connectivity to how hands-on you want the file transfer process to be."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Some Printer Frames Hold Calibration Longer Than Others Between Prints",
    "explanation": "A 3D printer's frame rigidity affects how often you need to re-level or re-calibrate between prints, a sturdier frame (often aluminum extrusion with cross-bracing) holds calibration across many prints, while a lighter or less rigid frame can shift enough during transport or vibration to need frequent re-leveling, check build quality reviews if you want to minimize recurring calibration maintenance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "An Enclosure Matters More for Certain Filaments and Home Environments Than Others",
    "explanation": "Whether an enclosure is worth the extra cost or DIY effort depends on what you're printing and where, if you stick to PLA in a stable room, an open-frame printer performs fine, if you plan to print ABS, nylon, or other warping-prone materials, or your printer sits somewhere drafty, an enclosure meaningfully improves print reliability and reduces fume exposure."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Filament Run-Out Detection Prevents Wasted Hours on Long Prints",
    "explanation": "A 3D printer with a filament run-out sensor automatically pauses the print and alerts you when the spool empties mid-print, without this sensor a long multi-hour print simply fails silently once filament runs out, wasting the print time and material already used, this feature matters most for printers running long unattended prints rather than short supervised jobs."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What happens if filament runs out mid-print?",
    "a": "Without a filament run-out sensor, the print simply fails and wastes everything printed so far, this matters most for long unattended prints, check for this feature if you run extended jobs."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Should I print at the printer's maximum advertised speed?",
    "a": "Usually not for best quality, max speed often introduces visible ringing or dimensional drift, most users get better results dialing back somewhat from the advertised ceiling."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Should I get an FDM or resin 3D printer?",
    "a": "FDM produces sturdier functional parts at lower cost with visible layer lines, resin produces far finer detail and smoother surfaces but requires ventilation and messier post-processing with isopropyl alcohol, match to what you're actually printing."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Will any nozzle work with any filament?",
    "a": "No, abrasive filaments like carbon-fiber-infused or metal-infused wear down a standard brass nozzle quickly, a hardened steel or ruby-tipped nozzle holds up much longer with those materials."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Is automatic bed leveling worth paying extra for?",
    "a": "It saves real recurring setup time if you print frequently, manual leveling requires adjusting corner screws and checking with a feeler gauge before nearly every session."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "How do I know what build volume I actually need?",
    "a": "Check it against your largest realistically planned print with margin, the stated volume is a hard maximum and real prints need edge clearance, don't buy sized exactly to your biggest project."
