  {
    "criterion": "Standalone and PC-Tethered Headsets Solve Different Priorities",
    "explanation": "A standalone VR headset runs its own processor and battery with no computer or cables required, convenient and portable but limited to less graphically intensive experiences than a PC can render, a PC-tethered headset relies on a connected computer's GPU for far more demanding visuals but requires a cable (or a strong wireless streaming setup) and a capable gaming PC, match the type to whether portability or peak visual fidelity matters more."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Controller Tracking Accuracy Varies Even Between Headsets With Similar Specs",
    "explanation": "A VR headset's motion controllers depend on the same tracking system as the headset itself, and tracking quality can degrade when controllers move outside the headset's camera view, such as behind your back or at extreme angles for fast motion games, check reviews specifically for controller tracking complaints in fast-paced or full-body-motion games if that's your primary use case, rather than assuming all modern controllers track equally reliably."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Inside-Out Tracking Is More Convenient but Can Struggle in Certain Rooms",
    "explanation": "Most modern VR headsets use inside-out tracking, where cameras on the headset itself track your position without needing external sensors placed around the room, convenient for setup, but inside-out tracking can struggle in rooms with poor lighting, reflective surfaces, or very open layouts, an older external-sensor tracking system is more setup work but can be more consistently accurate in a difficult room, check reviews for tracking reliability if your play space has unusual lighting or layout."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Higher Refresh Rates Reduce Motion Sickness for Sensitive Users",
    "explanation": "Refresh rate matters for comfort as much as visual smoothness in VR, users prone to motion sickness generally do better with headsets running at 90Hz or higher, a lower refresh rate can worsen the disconnect between head movement and visual update that triggers discomfort, if motion sickness has been an issue before, this spec deserves priority over resolution or other headline numbers."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Pancake Lenses Enable Slimmer Headsets With Fewer Visual Artifacts Than Fresnel",
    "explanation": "Lens technology has a real visible impact on VR image quality that a resolution spec alone doesn't capture, Fresnel lenses are cheaper but produce visible light streaking around bright objects on dark backgrounds, pancake lenses reduce this glare and allow a slimmer headset design at a typically higher price, check which lens type is used if this artifact has bothered you on a previous headset."

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does VR tracking work in any room?",
    "a": "Inside-out tracking can struggle in poorly lit rooms, near reflective surfaces, or unusually shaped spaces, check specific tracking reliability reviews if your play space has any of these challenges."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What resolution should I look for in a VR headset?",
    "a": "Check the true per-eye resolution, not a combined total across both eyes, a low per-eye resolution can produce a visible screen door effect that's especially distracting when reading in-game text."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Which VR headset is most comfortable for long sessions?",
    "a": "Check reviews for weight distribution, not just total weight, a design with rear-mounted weight like a battery pack balances the load better than a front-heavy design that concentrates weight on the face."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What if a VR headset doesn't fit my eyes clearly?",
    "a": "Check the IPD adjustment range, a headset with only a few fixed steps may leave users outside the average range with a persistently blurry image, a continuous adjustment range accommodates more people."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What are 'god rays' in a VR headset?",
    "a": "Light streaking around bright objects against dark backgrounds, common with cheaper Fresnel lenses, newer pancake lens designs reduce this glare meaningfully but typically cost more."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does field of view really matter in VR?",
    "a": "Yes, more than most buyers expect, a narrow field of view can feel like looking through a mask, a wider field of view meaningfully increases immersion, especially for exploration-focused content."
