  {
    "criterion": "Automatic Bed Leveling Saves Real Setup Time Over Manual Leveling",
    "explanation": "A 3D printer with automatic bed leveling uses a sensor to map the print bed's surface and compensate for minor unevenness before each print, a genuine time-saver over manual leveling, which requires physically adjusting screws at each corner and re-checking with a feeler gauge, auto-leveling isn't well suited and doesn't replace an occasional manual check, but it removes a real recurring maintenance task for frequent printing."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Filament Run-Out Detection Prevents Wasted Hours on Long Prints",
    "explanation": "Without a filament run-out sensor, a 3D printer has no way to detect an empty spool mid-print, the print simply fails and wastes everything printed up to that point, this matters significantly more for long unattended overnight prints than short prints you supervise start to finish, check for this feature if you plan to run extended unattended print jobs."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Check Build Volume Against Your Actual Largest Planned Print, Not the Average",
    "explanation": "Don't buy a 3D printer sized exactly to your largest planned print, the stated build volume is a hard maximum and real prints need edge clearance and calibration margin, if you'll regularly print near that ceiling, choose a printer with meaningfully more build volume than your typical largest project."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "FDM and Resin Printers Solve Different Printing Needs",
    "explanation": "An FDM (fused deposition modeling) 3D printer extrudes melted plastic filament layer by layer, producing functional, durable parts at lower cost and mess but with visible layer lines, a resin printer cures liquid resin with light for far finer detail and smoother surfaces, ideal for miniatures or jewelry, but resin handling requires ventilation, gloves, and post-processing with isopropyl alcohol, match the technology to whether you need functional durability or fine surface detail."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "SD Card, USB, and Wi-Fi Options Change How You Actually Send Print Jobs",
    "explanation": "A 3D printer that only accepts an SD card requires physically moving the card between your computer and the printer for every job, a USB connection lets you print directly from slicing software but ties the printer to a nearby computer during the entire print, Wi-Fi connectivity lets you send jobs remotely and monitor progress from another room, match the connectivity to how hands-on you want the file transfer process to be."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Should I get an FDM or resin 3D printer?",
    "a": "FDM produces sturdier functional parts at lower cost with visible layer lines, resin produces far finer detail and smoother surfaces but requires ventilation and messier post-processing with isopropyl alcohol, match to what you're actually printing."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "",
    "a": "It varies significantly by model, quieter stepper drivers and fan designs make a real difference, check specific noise-level reviews if the printer will run somewhere you spend time like a bedroom or office."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What happens if filament runs out mid-print?",
    "a": "Without a filament run-out sensor, the print simply fails and wastes everything printed so far, this matters most for long unattended prints, check for this feature if you run extended jobs."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Do I need an enclosed 3D printer?",
    "a": "Only if you plan to print warping-prone materials like ABS or nylon, or your room is drafty, PLA in a stable room works fine on an open-frame printer."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Is automatic bed leveling worth paying extra for?",
    "a": "It saves real recurring setup time if you print frequently, manual leveling requires adjusting corner screws and checking with a feeler gauge before nearly every session."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "How do I know what build volume I actually need?",
    "a": "Check it against your largest realistically planned print with margin, the stated volume is a hard maximum and real prints need edge clearance, don't buy sized exactly to your biggest project."
