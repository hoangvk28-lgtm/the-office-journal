export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "An Automatic Cutter Saves Real Time at Volume but Adds a Failure Point",
    "explanation": "Automatic cutters add genuine convenience at high volume but introduce a wear part that eventually needs cleaning or replacement, a simple tear-bar edge has nothing to break but slows down repetitive high-volume printing, check your realistic daily label count before paying extra for a cutter you may not need."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Bluetooth and Wi-Fi Convenience Comes With a Real Setup and Reliability Tradeoff",
    "explanation": "Wireless connectivity on a label printer trades a small reliability risk for real mobility, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi models let you print from anywhere in range but are more prone to dropped connections than a wired USB printer, if the printer has a permanent desk spot a USB-only model is often the more dependable choice."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Established Brands Generally Offer Longer Driver Support Than Newer Budget Entrants",
    "explanation": "A label printer from an established brand like Zebra, Brother, or DYMO typically receives driver updates and OS compatibility patches for years after purchase, a newer or lesser-known budget brand may stop updating drivers once a model is discontinued, check the manufacturer's update history if long-term software compatibility matters for your setup."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Thermal Transfer Ribbon Cost Adds a Real Recurring Expense Direct Thermal Doesn't Have",
    "explanation": "A thermal transfer label printer needs a fresh ribbon roughly proportional to how much label stock you print, a recurring cost that direct thermal printers don't carry at all, factor the ongoing ribbon expense into your real cost per label before choosing thermal transfer purely for its longer label lifespan."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Higher DPI Only Matters for Small Text and Barcodes, Not Every Label Type",
    "explanation": "203 DPI and 300 DPI look identical on a large shipping label but diverge sharply on small text or fine barcodes, if your labels include small print, 2D codes, or fine detail, the higher DPI model earns its price premium, if you're printing large simple shipping labels the standard resolution is usually enough."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Will a label printer handle labels wider than shipping labels?",
    "a": "Only up to its stated maximum width, a printer rated for 4-inch shipping labels physically cannot print wider, check the max width spec against your actual intended label size, not just the shipping use case shown in marketing."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Are battery-powered label printers slower than plug-in models?",
    "a": "Generally yes, a battery-powered unit gives you true portability for warehouse or on-site printing but typically runs slower and handles smaller batches per charge than a desktop model on constant power."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Why does a thermal transfer printer cost more to run over time?",
    "a": "It needs a fresh ribbon roughly proportional to your print volume, a real recurring cost direct thermal printers don't have, factor this into your actual cost per label before choosing thermal transfer purely for label longevity."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What's the difference between direct thermal and thermal transfer label printers?",
    "a": "Direct thermal burns the image into heat-sensitive paper with no ink, cheaper to run but labels fade within months, thermal transfer melts a ribbon onto standard stock for labels that last years but costs more per label due to the ribbon."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Do I need 300 DPI or is 203 DPI enough?",
    "a": "203 DPI is fine for large simple shipping labels, but if your labels include small text, fine barcodes, or 2D codes, 300 DPI produces noticeably crisper results worth the price difference."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "How do I know if a label printer works with my shipping platform?",
    "a": "Check the manufacturer's actual compatibility list for your specific platform (Shopify, eBay, Etsy, or a carrier's software), broad 'works with everything' marketing claims are often less precise than the real driver support."
