export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "Wattage vs Actual Room Size",
    "explanation": "Matching wattage to room size prevents both underheating and wasted electricity: the common benchmark is 10 watts per square foot, meaning a 1,500-watt heater (the practical ceiling for a standard 15-amp outlet) suits about 150 square feet. A unit that only offers 750 or 900 watts on its low setting will struggle in anything larger than a small room, while an oversized heater in a small space cycles on and off more than it needs to. Look for the room-size figure in the listing and compare it honestly against your actual square footage."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Tip-Over and Overheat Protection Are Non-Negotiable",
    "explanation": "Every legitimate space heater sold today should include two distinct safety mechanisms: a tip-over switch that cuts power the instant the unit is knocked past a certain angle, and a separate overheat thermal fuse that shuts it off if internal temperatures climb too high, independent of whether it's been tipped. These aren't the same feature, and a listing that only mentions one should raise a flag, especially in a home with kids, pets, or a heater placed on a rug or uneven surface where tipping is more likely."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Third-Party Safety Certification (UL, ETL, or CSA)",
    "explanation": "UL, ETL, and CSA certifications are independent verification, not marketing language, confirming a heater was tested against established safety standards for things like cord insulation, internal temperature limits, and overheat cutoffs. Given that space heaters are a documented leading cause of residential heating fires, a listing that doesn't clearly state one of these three certifications is missing information a buyer should actually require, not just a nice-to-have."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Ceramic vs Infrared vs Oil-Filled Heat Type",
    "explanation": "Ceramic heaters use a fan to push heat across a ceramic element, warming a room quickly but cooling down fast once switched off; infrared heaters warm objects and people directly via radiant heat rather than the air itself, which feels warmer faster in your immediate vicinity but doesn't heat the whole room evenly; oil-filled radiators heat slowly using a sealed reservoir of oil, but they stay warm long after being switched off and run silently since they have no fan. Pick ceramic for fast whole-room heat, infrared for near-instant warmth at a desk or chair, and oil-filled for quiet, sustained background heat overnight."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Running Cost at Full Wattage",
    "explanation": "23 an hour depending on local electricity rates, a cost that compounds quickly across a full winter of daily use. The real lever for controlling this isn't the heater's maximum wattage, it's whether it has a genuine low-power setting and a thermostat that cycles the unit off once the room reaches temperature, rather than running at full wattage the entire time it's plugged in."
  }
];

export const faq = [
  {
    "q": "What size space heater do I need for my room?",
    "a": "Use roughly 10 watts of heating power per square foot as a baseline, meaning a 1,500-watt heater (the practical ceiling for a standard household outlet) suits about a 150 square foot room; check the manufacturer's stated coverage against your room's actual square footage rather than assuming higher wattage always means better performance."
  },
  {
    "q": "Do all space heaters have tip-over protection?",
    "a": "They should, but not all listings make this clear: look specifically for both a tip-over shutoff (cuts power if knocked over) and a separate overheat thermal fuse (shuts off if internal temperature climbs too high), since these are two distinct safety mechanisms and a real safety-conscious heater needs both."
  },
  {
    "q": "Why does a UL, ETL, or CSA certification matter?",
    "a": "Safety standards rather than only self-certified by the manufacturer, which matters given that space heaters are a documented leading cause of residential heating fires; a listing missing all three certifications is a real gap to check for."
  },
  {
    "q": "Is a ceramic, infrared, or oil-filled heater better?",
    "a": "It depends on your priority: ceramic heats a room fastest but uses a fan and cools quickly once off, infrared warms you directly and near-instantly but doesn't heat the whole room evenly, and oil-filled radiators are slow to warm up but run silently and hold heat long after being switched off, best for quiet overnight bedroom use."
  },
  {
    "q": "How much does it cost to run a space heater all day?",
    "a": "Electricity rates, which adds up over a full day or a winter season; a heater with a genuine low-wattage setting and a working thermostat that cycles off once the room warms up can meaningfully reduce that cost versus one that runs at full wattage constantly."
  },
  {
    "q": "Are space heaters safe to leave on overnight?",
    "a": "Only with real tip-over and overheat protection, third-party safety certification, and at least three feet of clearance from bedding, curtains, or other flammable material; an oil-filled radiator is often the safer overnight choice specifically because it has no exposed heating element or fan."
