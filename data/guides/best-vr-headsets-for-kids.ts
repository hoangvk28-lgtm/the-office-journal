  {
    "criterion": "Internal Storage Caps How Many Apps and Games You Keep Installed at Once",
    "explanation": "VR game and app file sizes have grown considerably as the platform matures, a lower storage tier on a standalone headset fills up faster than most buyers expect, forcing regular uninstall-and-redownload cycles, if you plan to keep a substantial library installed at once, the storage upgrade is often worth the price difference over the base tier."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "IPD Adjustment Range Affects Whether the Headset Actually Fits Your Eyes Clearly",
    "explanation": "A VR headset's interpupillary distance (IPD) adjustment lets you match the lens spacing to your own eyes, a headset with a narrow or stepped IPD adjustment range may not focus clearly for users outside the average range, while a continuous, wide-range adjustment accommodates more face shapes, check the stated IPD adjustment range against your own measured IPD if you're unsure it falls within the average range a headset typically supports."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Standalone and PC-Tethered Headsets Solve Different Priorities",
    "explanation": "A standalone VR headset runs its own processor and battery with no computer or cables required, convenient and portable but limited to less graphically intensive experiences than a PC can render, a PC-tethered headset relies on a connected computer's GPU for far more demanding visuals but requires a cable (or a strong wireless streaming setup) and a capable gaming PC, match the type to whether portability or peak visual fidelity matters more."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Field of View Affects Immersion More Than Most Buyers Initially Expect",
    "explanation": "A VR headset's field of view (measured in degrees) determines how much of your peripheral vision is filled by the virtual scene, a narrower field of view (around 90-100 degrees) can feel like looking through binoculars or a diving mask, while a wider field of view (110 degrees and up) fills more of your natural vision for a meaningfully more immersive experience, this matters more for exploration and immersive games than for seated experiences like racing sims."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Per-Eye Resolution Determines Text Clarity and the 'Screen Door Effect'",
    "explanation": "A VR headset's resolution is typically stated per eye, lower per-eye resolution can produce a visible 'screen door effect' where the gaps between pixels are noticeable, especially distracting when reading in-game text, higher per-eye resolution reduces this effect substantially but demands more graphics processing power to render, check the stated per-eye resolution rather than a combined total, which can make a headset sound sharper than it actually is."

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What are 'god rays' in a VR headset?",
    "a": "Light streaking around bright objects against dark backgrounds, common with cheaper Fresnel lenses, newer pancake lens designs reduce this glare meaningfully but typically cost more."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does VR tracking work in any room?",
    "a": "Inside-out tracking can struggle in poorly lit rooms, near reflective surfaces, or unusually shaped spaces, check specific tracking reliability reviews if your play space has any of these challenges."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Does field of view really matter in VR?",
    "a": "Yes, more than most buyers expect, a narrow field of view can feel like looking through a mask, a wider field of view meaningfully increases immersion, especially for exploration-focused content."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Can a VR headset cause motion sickness?",
    "a": "It can, particularly at lower refresh rates, if you or the intended user is sensitive to VR discomfort, prioritize a headset running at 90Hz or higher over other specs."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Should I get a standalone or PC VR headset?",
    "a": "Standalone offers real freedom from cables and a computer but caps out at mobile-chip-level graphics, PC-tethered unlocks far more demanding visuals but needs a gaming PC and either a cable or a solid wireless streaming setup."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What if a VR headset doesn't fit my eyes clearly?",
    "a": "Check the IPD adjustment range, a headset with only a few fixed steps may leave users outside the average range with a persistently blurry image, a continuous adjustment range accommodates more people."
