export const buyingCriteria = [
  {
    "criterion": "SD Card, USB, and Wi-Fi Options Change How You Actually Send Print Jobs",
    "explanation": "How you get a file from your computer to the printer is a real daily workflow factor, SD-card-only means physically swapping the card each time, USB keeps a computer tied up for the print's duration, Wi-Fi lets you queue and monitor jobs remotely, this matters more the more frequently you print."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Some Printer Frames Hold Calibration Longer Than Others Between Prints",
    "explanation": "A 3D printer's frame rigidity affects how often you need to re-level or re-calibrate between prints, a sturdier frame (often aluminum extrusion with cross-bracing) holds calibration across many prints, while a lighter or less rigid frame can shift enough during transport or vibration to need frequent re-leveling, check build quality reviews if you want to minimize recurring calibration maintenance."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Standard Brass Nozzles Wear Out Quickly on Abrasive Filaments",
    "explanation": "A standard brass nozzle handles common filaments like PLA and PETG fine, but abrasive materials like carbon-fiber-infused or glow-in-the-dark filament wear down a brass nozzle's opening within a relatively short print volume, widening the hole and degrading print quality, a hardened steel or ruby-tipped nozzle resists this wear significantly longer, check nozzle material compatibility if you plan to print with any abrasive filament type."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "High Advertised Print Speeds Often Trade Off Against Surface Quality at Max Setting",
    "explanation": "The headline speed number on a 3D printer's box is real but rarely the setting you'll actually use for quality prints, pushing to maximum speed typically introduces visible artifacts like ringing or dimensional drift, most experienced users dial back from the advertised maximum for a better quality balance, treat the top speed spec as a ceiling, not a recommended default."
  },
  {
    "criterion": "Stepper Motor and Fan Noise Vary Significantly Between Printer Designs",
    "explanation": "A 3D printer's audible noise during printing comes mainly from stepper motors and cooling fans, some printers use quieter TMC stepper drivers and better-isolated fans for meaningfully lower noise, while budget models can run loud enough to be disruptive in a shared living space, check reviews specifically for noise level if the printer will run in a bedroom or shared workspace rather than a garage."
  }

export const faq = [
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Do I need an enclosed 3D printer?",
    "a": "Only if you plan to print warping-prone materials like ABS or nylon, or your room is drafty, PLA in a stable room works fine on an open-frame printer."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "",
    "a": "It varies significantly by model, quieter stepper drivers and fan designs make a real difference, check specific noise-level reviews if the printer will run somewhere you spend time like a bedroom or office."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "What happens if filament runs out mid-print?",
    "a": "Without a filament run-out sensor, the print simply fails and wastes everything printed so far, this matters most for long unattended prints, check for this feature if you run extended jobs."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Should I get an FDM or resin 3D printer?",
    "a": "FDM produces sturdier functional parts at lower cost with visible layer lines, resin produces far finer detail and smoother surfaces but requires ventilation and messier post-processing with isopropyl alcohol, match to what you're actually printing."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "Is automatic bed leveling worth paying extra for?",
    "a": "It saves real recurring setup time if you print frequently, manual leveling requires adjusting corner screws and checking with a feeler gauge before nearly every session."
  },
  {
    "id": "",
    "q": "How do I know what build volume I actually need?",
    "a": "Check it against your largest realistically planned print with margin, the stated volume is a hard maximum and real prints need edge clearance, don't buy sized exactly to your biggest project."
